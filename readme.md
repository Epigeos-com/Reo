This project corresponds to https://epigeos.com/hydor/reo  

It's totally not finished, e.g. the sunset/sunrise function isn't right and so all it's derivatives weren't even checked  
The TODO file is mixed from the previous state of the project and current, files also contain // TODO comments  
The build file is made specifically for x86_64 linux  

The frontend is based on SDL3, currently 3.2.8 and SDL3_ttf 3.2.2
And so the two are required for building, as well as Android NDK when targeting android
