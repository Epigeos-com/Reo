// Known issues:
Pressing esc on settings before an input field is unselected/unclicked leads to it being assigned to a var after the StateHasChanged() runs, so it doesn't update on the page (that's just a guess for why)
Setting latitude and longitude to current location needs at least two clicks of the button, which seems to be caused by how geolocation works, but tough to tell
